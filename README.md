Data Management Plan for the research project hydrodynamic model of square pool boiling surfaces.

Context of the project:

The primary goal of the research I am conducting is to validate a simplified model of heat transfer coefficients from boiling surfaces, with an emphasis on dielectric (non-conductive) fluids. For context, the majority of data centers around the world are primarily air cooled, and the lack of liquid cooling represents a relatively large inefficiency. Even without extensive knowledge of heat transfer, nearly everyone can identify a significant temperature difference between standing in a 70℉ room and swimming in a 70℉ pool. It happens that boiling the fluid enhances this perceived heat transfer by yet another order of magnitude. By then immersing computer processors in a fluid whose boiling point is near that of the ideal operating temperature of the processor, significant efficiency gains could be seen in cooling requirements for data centers. By studying certain behaviors of fluid flow in and around boiling surfaces we can validate a model which would allow the optimization of board design with respect to cooling capabilities much easier.
